  <h1 align="center">CLEF 2025 JOKER Track:</h1>
  <h2 align="center">Automatic Humour Analysis</h2> 

### Tasks, evaluation setup, and metrics
In the edition, we propose four shared tasks:
* **Task 1: Humour-aware information retrieval** Retrieving short humorous texts from a document collectionbased on a given query. The retrieved texts should fulfill the dualcriteria of being relevant to the query and being instances of wordplay. 
* **Task 2: Wordplay Translation** Translating English punning jokes into French. Translations should aim to preserve, to the extent possible, both the form and meaning of the original wordplay.
* **Task 3: Funny Names** A new task that is based on the extensions of the JOKER corpus 2022. Funny names are difficult to detect for modern AI and NLP models. The task asks to detect “funny names, and translate them from English to French. 
* **Task 4: Controlled Creativity** Identifying and avoiding hallucination. This is a possible new task coordinated between a number of tracks dealing with text generation tasks.The translation of humorous texts can require considerable creative effort, as a literal translation does not preserve the wordplay.

This makes the JOKER corpus of great interest to understand how much creative license is needed, and permissible, and when the distance between source and translation becomes too large to consider them the“same” wordplay in different languages.
