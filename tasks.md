  <h1 align="center">CLEF 2025 JOKER Track:</h1>
  <h2 align="center">Automatic Humour Analysis</h2> 

### Tasks, evaluation setup, and metrics
In the edition, we propose four shared tasks:
* **Task 1: Humour-aware information retrieval** Retrieving short humorous texts from a document collection based on a given query. The retrieved texts should fulfill the dual criteria of being relevant to the query and being instances of wordplay. 
* **Task 2: Wordplay Translation** Translating English punning jokes into French. Translations should aim to preserve, to the extent possible, both the form and meaning of the original wordplay.
* **Task 3: Onomastic Wordplay Translation** The objective of the task is to translate onomastic wordplay from English to French. Such wordplay is widely used as a rhetorical device in novels, poetry, and plays.
* **Task 4: Controlled Creativity** Identifying and avoiding hallucination. This is a possible new task coordinated between a number of tracks dealing with text generation tasks.The translation of humorous texts can require considerable creative effort, as a literal translation does not preserve the wordplay.

This makes the JOKER corpus of great interest to understand how much creative license is needed, and permissible, and when the distance between source and translation becomes too large to consider them the“same” wordplay in different languages.
