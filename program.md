  <h1 align="center">CLEF 2025 JOKER Track:</h1>
  <h2 align="center">Automatic Humour Analysis</h2> 

We envision a similar setup as in earlier years:
Track overview as part of the plenary conference program.
2024 BOTL paper as part of the plenary conference program.  
We got some impressive work by participants this year, and will recommend one of them for the ``Best of the Labs.''

We envision three parallel sessions of 1.5 hours on the track

Session 1: 
    Task overviews and keynote speaker.

Session 2: 
    Participant papers (longer presentation of best-performing submissions).

Session 3: 
    Participant papers (shorter presentations of those attending CLEF) and 

Session 4: 
    Planning and discussion on CLEF 2026 \track.

A short report of the plans for CLEF 2026 \track Track in the CLEF closing session.
