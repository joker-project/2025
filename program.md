%We got some impressive work by participants this year, and will recommend one of them for the ``Best of the Labs.''
\item We envision three parallel sessions of 1.5 hours on the track
\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item %Session 1: 
    Task overviews and keynote speaker.
    \item %Session 2: 
    Participant papers (longer presentation of best-performing submissions).
    \item %Session 3: 
    Participant papers (shorter presentations of those attending CLEF) and 
    %\item %Session 4: 
    Planning and discussion on CLEF 2026 \track.
\end{enumerate}
